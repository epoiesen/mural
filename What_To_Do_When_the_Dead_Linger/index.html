      <title>What To Do When The Dead Linger: Exploring Hauntedness as a Material Property of Objects</title>
       <meta name="description" content="This is the story of a material property that isn’t. It is not visible, it is not quantifiable, it isn’t even material. And yet, it is experienced (sometimes quite powerfully), and it has effects (sometimes quite dramatic)1. It is the sense that objects are haunted: somehow changed by the persisting agency of the dead; by an intrusion of those gone onto the living experience of the material world, both literally and figuratively. Yet, however potent the effects may be, experiences of hauntedness are still highly personal, subjective, and individual and thus elude the project of objective realism that underpins grounded archeological study. By its affective nature, hauntedness is a sensory experience that cannot be measured, replicated, or recorded, and this makes its study resistive to traditional methods. Yet archeology is uniquely positioned to engage with these points of overlap between the objective and subjective: straddling the sciences, humanities, and social sciences. So, instead of resisting this intersection of objectivity and subjectivity, this paper seeks to engage with it directly: interweaving narrative, image production, and analysis to explore hauntedness as a property of objects. In doing so, I hope not only to define and validate hauntedness as an important aspect of object materiality, but also to encourage creative approaches to the complex, resistive, often immaterial materiality of objects.">

                              Photograph of a clip-on earring from the late 20th century, composed of a brass mount and 8 glass gems. The earring was inherited from a female relative in the late 1990s and is currently in the possession of the author.

                    This is a story of an earring.<br><br>An ugly earring.<br><br>Cheaply made and cheaply bought, it is meant to resemble a queenly diamond in glass and brass. A large, 3 lobed brown jewel sits beneath a crown of small, round, apricot-colored gems in a color palette that now seems a stereotype of the 1970s. These faux diamonds have been haphazardly set into a thin, metal clip that pinches and weighs the ear unpleasantly. It was presumably once part of a pair, but its twin has long ago been lost in the back of a drawer or the case of a second-hand shop or (most likely) underneath 200ft of Tacoma landfill. It is, without doubt, an object out of place. I keep it in my jewelry box, but I have no intention of wearing it. It has no functionalist, aesthetic, or rational role in my life and there is really no reason that I should keep it.

                    Yet, I cling to it: not for what it is, or what it was, or what it could be; not for its value, not for its beauty, not for the hope that I may someday wear it. I cling to it because it was hers: the property of a great aunt, Bea, now dead. I keep it because it is full of memories: the memory of childhood visits and the smell of old perfume and hospital disinfectant. The memory of a somber distribution that I did not understand, and a jewelry box that I was too small to carry. The memory of a quiet presence, felt on the back of the neck in the superstitious hours. The memory of death and life and loss and obligation and the first thing I ever owned that glittered.

This paper seeks to shine a metaphorical spotlight on a single object: an heirloom piece of costume jewelry. The image production in this paper seeks to center this object in its visualizations as a practice of slow archeology [53][77], presenting a single object within many different visual-theoretical frames. In doing so, this paper seeks to present a depth of visual approaches to small object visualization.

                    This is the story of a material property that isn’t. It is not visible, it is not quantifiable, it isn’t even material. And yet, it is experienced (sometimes quite powerfully), and it has effects (sometimes quite dramatic)1. It is the sense that objects are haunted: somehow changed by the persisting agency of the dead; by an intrusion of those gone onto the living experience of the material world, both literally and figuratively. Yet, however potent the effects may be, experiences of hauntedness are still highly personal, subjective, and individual and thus elude the project of objective realism that underpins grounded archeological study. By its affective nature, hauntedness is a sensory experience that cannot be measured, replicated, or recorded, and this makes its study resistive to traditional methods. Yet archeology is uniquely positioned to engage with these points of overlap between the objective and subjective: straddling the sciences, humanities, and social sciences. So, instead of resisting this intersection of objectivity and subjectivity, this paper seeks to engage with it directly: interweaving narrative, image production, and analysis to explore hauntedness as a property of objects. In doing so, I hope not only to define and validate hauntedness as an important aspect of object materiality, but also to encourage creative approaches to the complex, resistive, often immaterial materiality of objects.

                              In this image, the archeological illustration of the earring is posed with two hands in a posture of recoil. Though this gesture is culturally contingent, so too is the reaction of trepidation, disgust, fear, or surprise that a ‘haunted’ object may evoke. This gesture is consistent with western reactions to hauntedness.

                    To ask whether hauntedness is _real_ is to ask the wrong question. The afterlife is a topic for philosophers, theologians, neuroscientists, and metaphysicians - and I leave it to them. Instead, this paper approaches hauntedness through the lens of Material Culture Studies, in which material identities are co-constituted in the relationships between people and objects[34][36][71]. Physical attributes and social attributes both converge in the perception of the world and reality is constructed on this intersection [19][24][34][55]. Within this frame, it doesn’t matter if the dead _actually_ linger on the material plane. If reality is constructed around a metaphysics that includes hauntedness as a material property, then individuals will interact with that world in reference to hauntedness[28]. In this framework, hauntedness is real enough: it exists in a reality that is co-constituted by physical senses, social contexts, and mental processes.[47][65] Just as placebos produce real medical outcomes[7], so to can cultural frameworks produce real experiences for those within them.

                    <p><br></p><p>Hauntedness is therefore a subjective property of object materiality. It is a property in which the dead imbue matter with agency. This agency may be physical[3], magical[28][55][75], and/or emotional[30][38], but it is a power that emerges from biographical associations between people and things[34][42]. It is a persistence of entanglement between the dead, the living, and material objects in a panoply of configurations across time and space[30][71].In this sense, haunted objects are a prime example of mixtures[71] or bundles[4]. They are both subject and object, human and nonhuman, real and unreal, effected by and effecting human consciousness, and full of contradictions and bifurcations[71]. They make the social physical and the physical social[4], entangling, mixing, and distributing human consciousness and object materiality[33]. They compress and distort time and disrupt the neat separation of past, present, and future[30][67].</p>

                    <p></p>It is precisely because haunted objects offer such a rich and complex materiality that they are useful for engaging archaeological theory. They provide an example of object agency derived from human subjects, yet at varying levels of intentionality[4][71]. They are vibrant matter, but it is a vibrancy that springs primarily from supernatural or affective sources as opposed to the materials of the objects themselves[36][55]. They are entangled, not only in “webs of life” [37], but webs beyond life, where the dead remain enmeshed in the living world[74] through their objects. Objects become links in a chain to nothing that nevertheless still hold the shape of that enchainment like a phantom limb [4][24]. Perhaps most fascinatingly, this resistant materiality can have a material expression. Haunted objects may evoke a sensory experiences that are both powerfully perceived and culturally constituted [3][2][44][49], complicating the frame of what constitute sensory approaches in archaeology.

                              The classic 'bedsheet' ghost that originated from the funerary practices of the European Middle Ages [50] is a now ubiquitous cliché of hauntedness. As such, it can act as a visual shorthand for hauntedness, such as the renderings of Egyptian Shaitan added to images of Egyptian archaeology [33]. In this image, however, a ghost is produced in a purposefully cartoonish way, as it is just such a childish, populist representation of haunting [29][40] that archeologists resist in their analysis of objects. It is therefore an image of what archeologists fear: that in exploring immaterial materialities of objects, they depart from a scientific, rational, and grounded study of the past.

                    Yet for all that these objects can enrich explorations of object materiality, they exist on the fringe of archaeology. They are, after all, superstitious objects, displaying a materiality that exists outside the natural sciences and the objective goals of processual archaeology [10][19]. Haunted objects appear to embody a form of “magical” thinking that is seen as decidedly unmodern, unenlightened, uneducated, and irrational[2][55][28][75]. Hauntedness, along with magic, folklore, and superstition are therefore relegated to the outskirts of the discipline[16][19], or worse still, left to the purview of pseudo-archaeology in its hunt for ghosts, curses, aliens, and monsters[9][32][75]. These explorations of hauntedness might further appear to skirt the symbolic and psychoanalytic approaches of post-processualism, focusing on the meaning of things [37][38]; a particularly fraught project when no resources are available for emic analysis[10].

                              Digital 3D modelling is often touted for its ability to present object dimensionality more accurately than ever before. Yet it also facilitates creative approaches to visualizing objects, allowing for the modeler to play with lighting, angle, texture, material, etc. As such, it is possible to explore the affective dimensionality [38] of objects, through diverse approaches to staging, mood, evocation, etc.

                    <p></p>This paper does not seek to embark on such a project of meaning making (much less a project of ghost hunting). This paper instead seeks to recognize hauntedness as part of the “murk[y] middle ground” in explorations of folk ritual beliefs[10]. It is a sphere of causality that exists in tandem with objective causality[55]. By dismissing it, we may “build false assumptions about what the ‘real world’ is like”[28], secularizing, rationalizing, and suppressing the often powerful effects of heritage[11][55]. As we collect a library of sensory experience through which to examine objects[26][27][35], a focus on the physical senses alone may well be inconsistent with the ontologies that framed (and frame) the experience of the material world[11][28]. In failing to recognize that sensory experiences may be informed by these deep spiritual, cultural frameworks, we are doomed to an idea of sensitivity that is sanitized and one-dimensional.

                    <p></p><p>Indeed, attempts to measure and record evidence of ghosts and spirits quickly diverge into the realms of ghost hunting [3], spiritualism[2], and pseudo-archeology[9][32]. Instead, subjective questions require a more subjective toolkit: one that engages this subjectivity, as opposed to resisting or obscuring it[70]. This paper deploys two such tools to explore hauntedness as a material property of objects. The first is auto-ethnographic storytelling [3][30][38], and the second is visual artistic practice[22][30][70]. In doing so, I seek to demonstrate the ways that creative practice can be deployed to enrich more traditional forms of analysis.<br></p>

                    <p><br></p>Drawing from anthropology, the use of auto-ethnographic storytelling is quite commonplace in the discipline, and has been very effectively deployed to explore affective aspects of memory [30][43], ruination[60], materials [34][36], etc. This mode of engagement is particularly appropriate in relationship to haunting, as first-hand accounts of haunting experience are a key element of ghost belief [3]. Moreover, ghosts and hauntings frequently appear as a conceptual metaphor in heritage study in reference to things that are abandoned, concealed, or suppressed[2]. In the logocentric context of professional academia[40], auto-ethnographic storytelling is the logical creative extension for archeological analysis, but this reflexivity is hardly the exclusive remit of the written word.

                    <p><br></p>Image production offers a different form of storytelling, but one in which the discipline is far less comfortable[70]. Though social sciences, and particularly anthropology, have begun experimenting with new visual modes of engagement[29], images are often still treated with suspicion or hostility [53][70]. Though a visually rich discipline [64][70] exposed to an increasingly rich visual media landscape[61], archeology often struggles with visual literacy[32][40][59][63][70]. There are fears that images are overly subjective in production[52], interpretively unstable [40][70][61], and able to achieve a false sense of authority, concealing nefarious theoretical or political intentions behind pleasant aesthetics[32][40][53][54][52]. If the visual is associated with the real and objective[55] and archeological images are expected to present authoritative and accurate depictions of the world [70] any deviance from realism is a necessarily a betrayal of truth.

                              This image attempts to present the earring in a 'sinister light' Drawing from films, plays, and other visual media, this image uses red light as a visual metaphor for danger[78].

                    <p><br></p>These fears are not unfounded, but stem from a foundational naiveté around the affordances of images[70]. Images cannot be perfect, objective representations of an object[64]. Images and image-making are culturally, socially, and perceptually relative[52], not to mention dependent on the skill, knowledge, and experience of the artist[64]. Viewers inherently apply their own prejudices as they interpret art[40][70] and these will change and shift over time and context[61]. Images cannot be innocent: they have agendas as part of their _raison d’etre_[52][64], and to expect otherwise is to fail to engage with the nuance inherent in all forms of knowledge production.

                    <p><br></p>Each of these concerns can equally be levied at the written word: written analysis of objects is culturally contingent [34][73], words are frequently misinterpreted by audiences[75], and articles are published with explicit theoretical (and implicit political) agendas. The difference here is simply one of literacy: archeologists are comfortable in textual analysis, but not in visual analysis[32][59]. Furthermore, these concerns over images are not without their paternalistic undertones. Images are widely popular and accessible – often more so than words[32][61]. If even children can see and comprehend an image[29][40], how then can the public be trusted to come to the “correct” conclusions? The dense language of academic prose, however, is guaranteed to admit only those whose intellectual credentials are sufficient to navigate a landscape of archaic latinates, technical jargon, and tangled grammatical structures.

                              One of the simplest means of incorporating the subjective role of the archeological illustrator in image production is to literally include the illustrator in the image, in this case as a posed hand holding the object. This helps overcome the conceit of scientific illustrations as authorless and objective [59].

                    <p><br></p>Yet, it is because of this very subjectivity that images can be useful to engage with more culturally contingent questions. Images facilitate the “ability to explore subjective, problematic, personal, empathic, emotional and un-quantifiable elements of archeological material that is not available to scientific approaches”[70]. Making images of archeological material facilitates a different type of interaction with artefacts. It encourages a different style of looking and seeing[29], slowing down and focusing engagements with archeological material[53] and structuring interpretations of the archeological record[53][70]. Making images of archeological material allows for an interaction that is distinctly personal, embodied, and intentional[29][53] and therefore one which highlights different visual data than traditional recording tools such as photography or photogrammetry[29].

                              The resistive agency of objects is not something that can be quantified, but it is nevertheless an element of object materiality that archeology is deeply interested in. Attempting to visualize this aspect of object materiality highlights the curious metaphorical materiality of archeological theory in which words shape the ways that objects are understood.

                    <p><br></p>Image production and storytelling have the capacity to engage with time, both in the temporal experience of making, and the ways in which time can be compressed into a single image[29][30][53]. They allow for a more open-ended exploration of personal involvement, intuition, and affective experience[63], and in doing so, offer a resistive means of knowledge production[63][70]. Yet these new and resistive ways knowledge production should not be seen as a replacements for traditional approaches to archeological material. Objective techniques are powerful and valuable in addressing objective questions. Yet these tools prove insufficient to examine the full spectrum of materiality. Instead, more subjective, creative approaches serve as a supplement to the existing approaches in archeology: offering access to new types of data to enrich the archeological record [5][70].

These three types of hauntedness represent an organizational conceit rather than a categorical, exhaustive, or static scheme. After all, one type of materiality does not preclude others – occulted or otherwise[55]. These three are presented instead to illustrate the diverse ways objects provoke human affectivity and affect human perceptions and actions [24][38].</span><p></p><p></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(206, 198, 206);"><br></span></p><span style="background-color: rgb(206, 198, 206);">Hauntedness may therefore be quite literal, where objects are _possessed_ by an affecting agent directly. This is an occulted materiality that is most explicitly supernatural, in which ghosts and spirits of the dead act directly upon the living in material ways[55]. Yet, hauntedness need not be so direct, with objects providing a conduit for _aura_: a non-living agency that presents as a charismatic or magical potency. Here, the dead themselves do not act upon the living, but imbue objects with a capacity to produce effects. Hauntedness may even be figurative, as an object triggers memory and emotion associated with the dead. This type of hauntedness encompasses the idea of spectrality: the spatio-temporal memory of an object, but this affectivity may not be entirely in the control of those in whom emotion and memory is provoked[30]. Though aspects of hauntedness need not be mutually exclusive, this paper will examine each separately as a case study in exploring hauntedness using creative approaches.</span><p></p><p></p>

                    <p><br></p>The first definition of hauntedness is the most literal: that of possession. Possession here is defined as the belief that an object is inhabited by a non-corporeal agent and imbued with the direct agency of the non-living. Often (though not exclusively) human, these actors are perceived by the senses: sight, smell, sound, touch, or even taste [3][2][44][49][75]. A key affordance of these objects is their ability to house and/or facilitate direct encounters with the supernatural in a way that can be physically experienced – and to believers, photographed and measured [3][2]. These experiences are the acts of specific agents who – within the metaphysics of hauntedness – exist in the perceivable world [3].

                    <p><br></p>Belief in ghosts and spirits is hardly antiquated or remote but remains a persistent part of modern life around the world[11][44][55][75]. In a 2005 Gallup poll, 49% of American adult respondents expressed a belief in ghosts, 39% expressing a belief that places could be haunted, and 22% reporting having lived in a place they believed to be haunted[3]. Even those who don’t believe in ghosts and spirits recognize the effects that these beliefs have on the material world: the sedate context of property law recognizes hauntedness as a factor that can affect the resale value of a houses[69].

                              A common representation of ghosts and spirits in popular culture and contemporary folklore is as a shadowy figure [80]. Here, a spectral figure is layered into the background of an archeological model in order to convey the sense that the object is a conduit for the agency of the dead.

                    <p><br></p>Hauntedness is, perhaps unsurprisingly, particularly prevalent within cultural heritage contexts. By far, the dominant representation of archaeological objects in modern cinema is in reference to their supernatural aspects[32] and the media surrounding ghosts and hauntings has ballooned in recent years [3]. More recently, the “spinning statuette” at the Manchester Museum was interpreted by the public as a “potential vessel for the spirit of a deceased ancient Egyptian” (among other interpretations). This led to a massive uptick in interest, popularity, speculation, enthusiasm, and museum attendance[75]. The British Museum has also faced difficulty dispelling ideas of a “mummy’s curse” and malevolent spirits that linger around a 21st or 22nd dynasty mummy in their collection[48].

Visitors, staff, and paranormal investigators attest to both seeing and hearing paranormal actors [49]. Mariana Lamas and Eduardo Giménez-Cassina outline instances of museum sites and objects that are perceived as haunted or have had paranormal incidents in the past few decades[44]. So popular is this connection between heritage and possession, that a whole industry of dark tourism and ghost tours has sprung up around those seeking encounters with the dead [3][66].

In the most literal sense, heritage professionals are often called upon to engage with public experiences of hauntedness[22][44][75]. Yet, on a more personal level, archeologists have been entangled with experiences of hauntedness. The history of archeology is one that is entwined with the spiritualist movement, with some early investigators deploying psychometry, psychics, biometers, and automated writing as part of archaeological research[2]. Even as these methods fell out of favor in the scientific community, many still espoused beliefs in the occult in their personal life, even as spirits disappeared from publication[2].

Sitting around the sherd bucket at the end of the day, I have heard many a tenured professor recount stories of uncanny engagements with historical material: things falling in storerooms, footsteps in empty hallways, and dark shapes disappearing in the night. In these moments of camaraderie, in the hot sun or the cold musty dimness of the storeroom, we tell each-other stories of things we know to be unreal. Stories of an unexplained discomfort and unshakable unease. Stories of an illicit imaginary; dismissed yet persistent. Stories of the past spilling into the present from those charged with drawing firm lines between the two. Stories we keep telling.

Aura is a slippery term, but is here employed to describe the ways in which objects can provoke a reverential[31], spiritual[25], empathic[31], or even magical[12][75] sense of awe. It is the sense that an object is special, and by its special nature, is able to produce effects. Unlike possession, whereby specific agents work directly though objects, this type of haunting describes the way that an object may act as a conduit for the residual or indirect agency of the non-living. It is an agency that lacks the intentionality of direct human action, but one which nevertheless derives its potency from a human source[50]. It is also an experience of haunting that need not be so explicitly sensory, but may instead present as a highly affective experience[31]: a feeling of entanglement that manifests as a sense of magical agency, charge, or energy[16][44].

This concept of object aura is essentially an emotional manifestation of object biography. In the classical object-biographic approach, objects accumulate meaning through their social interactions, with the biography of the object framed by the ways it intersects with the biographies of human beings[23][42]. Though post-humanist approaches to objects have challenged this anthropocentric focus[57][34], these human entanglements are nevertheless deeply relevant to the auratic potency of objects [15][17]. In fact, it is this history of objects that generate this auratic quality which is then substantiated by its material properties[31]. Objects become powerful in their associations with people, and they retain this power as part of their materiality[15].</span><p></p><p><sub style="background-color: rgb(206, 198, 206);">In cultural heritage contexts, labels are a primary medium by which objects are denoted as special [8]. Archeological labels and museum labels each tie an object into an object biographical framework - relating the entanglements that separate an ordinary object from an extraordinary object.</sub></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(247, 247, 247);">

This is particularly notable in celebrity possessions and memorabilia, from Theresa Tang’s watches[20] to tickets to a David Bowie concert[76], to a Manson family quilt[15]. Objects act as material nodes in the entanglements between people, in which the charisma of the dead lingers through the objects were associated with.

                    <p><br></p>This aura may also have more practical effects, however, particularly in reference to sacred objects that have been empowered by the influences of important or sacred people [11][44]. Objects may possess an aura that is empowered to enact material change such as healing[13][16][18], disaster prevention, luck[16][48], or harm [13][48]. Steph Berns describes the sacred aura of relics and devotional material that were associated with Catholic saints., describing this aura in terms of ‘holy radioactivity’ or ‘contact relics’ that exist within the relics and can also pass to personal objects that come in contact with the relics or even the reliquaries that house them[8]. It is a holiness that stems from the associations with saints and/or saintly remains that make these objects conduits of and surrogates for the presence of non-living saints[8]. The power of these objects can be potent both in the spiritual and emotional plane, but in the material one as well.

                    <p><br></p>The idea that objects have an emotional or quasi-magical power derived from their associations with people is a familiar concept in the study of cultural heritage[12][21][68]. Yet this element of object materiality is strikingly subjective, contingent, and affective[12][31]. While the physical properties of an object, such as patina or damage, are relevant to these auratic experiences of awe[12], the foundations of these experiences lie outside the physical properties[31], or even the authenticity[17] of the objects themselves. It is an experience that deviates from an agenda of objectivity, but which is accepted as a property of object materiality that is worthy of study [12][76]. What may set this immaterial materiality apart is the way in which its existence serves to legitimize the project of cultural heritage generally. If certain objects are inherently special, their study is inherently important[12].

                    <p><br></p>A third distinct definition of hauntedness in objects, is when objects are imbued with _memory_. In these objects, a key material property is the way in which it can evoke memories of the dead. These objects of memory therefore exhibit a referential agency: they are not conduits for the agency of the dead so much as they are surrogates for them[30]. Within the affective turn, memory is a potent element of object materiality[38] in which past and present interact, overlap, and disrupt one another[30]. The biography of such memory objects constitutes a concretion of events, actions, objects, people, memory, time, and emotion into a physical referent[38][71]. And while these objects may be a “repository of collective memory”[19], they may also be a site of “relentless remembering"[67], that evoke memories involuntarily[30] as associated neural networks activate one another[50]. Memory acts through an object, as the biographical associations materialize as a powerful, personal, and emotional experiences of objects.

                    <p><br></p>In one way or another, all objects act as sites of memory[51], but some objects have a particular potency in their associations with the dead. Roberta Gilchrist points to heirlooms, particularly as prompts for autobiographical memory. She links them to Mauss’s concept of inalienable objects that absorb the essence of the giver [19]. In the most literal sense, they reflect the taste of the original owner, extending their material judgements beyond their lifespan[20]. Yet they may also take the place of the dead, becoming the new site of memory and comfort when the human link is severed[51]. Not only do they testify to the past [15], but through this capacity to store and trigger memory[30][51] they allow the past to persist and the dead to remain entangled with the living. Thus, they are sites of haunting: not the literal vessels for spirits or conduits for undead power, but as tools through which the dead can be reanimated through the act of remembering. They are vessels that allow a return to a time before death[30], and so keep the dead alive in affective experiences of the present.

Somehow, in owning it, I can erase death and decades and reanimate that love that lingers in the shape of her. I keep this earring because it is a site of memory.

I know how to measure bones and photograph coffin furniture and draw the little objects left behind. So, I really should know better. Decluttering is the fashion, now, and between moves and cleanouts and therapy sessions centered around my emotional relationship to stuff, I should have disposed of this little piece of kitsch long ago. I should have accepted that death is the end, that “acquits us of all obligations”

They mediate our relationships with things: their agencies bursting through the material world in unique disruptions of time and space. It is not our job as archaeologists to capture these ghosts, but to leave space for them. When objects resist, we need to engage with that resistance: making art, telling stories, and laying bare our own failings in rationality. In delving, as best we can, into these interstitial and interdisciplinary spaces we can begin to unwind the complex webs of agencies, entanglements, and narratives of which we are a part. After all, archaeology does not put the dead to rest but unsettles them, re-vives them, and weaves them back into life. We are in the business of telling ghost stories, one way or another. And if we are to tell them, we should learn to tell them well.<p><br></p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p><br></p><p>Thank you to Amy, for hunting down family photographs, to Bill and Marge, for their wonderful collection of images, to Shawn, for his unwavering enthusiasm, and to Bea, who inspired it all. <br></p>
